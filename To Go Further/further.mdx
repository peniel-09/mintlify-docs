# Going Further

Congratulations on building your robot! If you're looking for the next challenge, here are a few ideas to take your project to the next level.

### 1. Add Reverse (The H-Bridge)
The pivot turn is good, but a "reverse and turn" maneuver is even more effective for escaping corners. This requires a circuit called an **H-Bridge**.
- **What it does:** An H-Bridge allows you to reverse the polarity of a motor, making it spin backward.
- **How to build it:** You can build one from four transistors or use a dedicated H-Bridge IC like the **L293D**, which is a great next step in learning electronics.

### 2. Add LEDs and Sound
Give your robot more personality!
- **LED Eyes:** Add an LED to each motor circuit so it lights up when the motor is running.
- **Buzzer:** Add a piezo buzzer that makes a sound whenever a whisker is pressed to signal it has hit an obstacle.

### 3. Design a Custom PCB
Ready to make your robot permanent and durable?
- Move your design from the breadboard to a soldered Printed Circuit Board (PCB). Designing your own PCB is a very rewarding skill in electronics.

### 4. Combine Logics: Obstacles + Light
For a truly advanced analog robot, you can combine the whisker-bot logic with the light-follower logic.
- **The Challenge:** Can you design a circuit where the robot follows a light source by default, but uses its whiskers to navigate around any obstacles it encounters along the way?
