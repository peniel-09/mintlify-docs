### Wiring the Right Side

For this section, you will need: the right motor, the right whisker switch (must be an SPDT switch with 3 pins), an LED, a buzzer, and a small resistor (220Ω or 330Ω is perfect).

**1. Connect Power to the Switch**
- Take your **Right Whisker Switch**. It has 3 pins: COM (Common), NC (Normally Closed), and NO (Normally Open).
- Connect a wire from the positive power rail (**+**) to the **COMMON (COM)** pin of the switch.

**2. Wire the Motor (Default ON)**
- Connect the **NORMALLY CLOSED (NC)** pin of the switch to the positive terminal of the **Right Motor**.
- Connect the other terminal of the motor to the ground rail (**-**).
- **Result:** When the robot is powered on and the whisker is not touched, the motor will run.

**3. Wire the Indicator (LED + Buzzer)**
- Connect the **NORMALLY OPEN (NO)** pin of the switch to one leg of your **220Ω resistor**.
- Connect the other leg of the resistor to the **longer leg** (anode) of your LED.
    <Info>The resistor is very important! It protects your LED from burning out.</Info>
- Connect the **shorter leg** (cathode) of the LED to the positive pin of the **Buzzer**.
- Connect the negative pin of the **Buzzer** to the ground rail (**-**).
- **Result:** When the whisker is pressed, the motor will stop and the LED and buzzer will turn on.

### Wiring the Left Side

Now, simply repeat the exact same 3 steps for the left side of the robot.
- Use the **Left Whisker Switch**.
- Use the **Left Motor**.
- Use your second LED, buzzer, and resistor.

The final circuit is a perfect mirror image of the first side.

### Final Check
- Before connecting the batteries, gently press each whisker. You should hear a small "click" from the switch.
- Double-check that your LEDs are the right way around (the long leg should be connected to the resistor/switch).

Once you've checked your wiring, you're ready to power it on!

<Info>
Building and testing one side completely before starting the second can make troubleshooting easier.
